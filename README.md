### Suggestions

To improve the prediction process of essay, Maybe we can count numbers of comma, colon, semi-colon and any other punctuations sepearately. By counting numbers of punctuations, we can specifically analyze the styles of sentences in essay - can analyze general style of writing for each author.  For example, we can analyze whether complex sentences are used more than simple sentences. Through this process, readers can clearly identify the differences of writing patterns between authors, which makes finding unknown authors easier

Another suggestion can be analyzing average number of paragraphs. By analyzing number of paragraphs in each essay of author, we can find out whether author writes long with detailed explanation, or writes shortly with straightforward explanation
